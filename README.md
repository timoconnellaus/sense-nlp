This project is an extension for Qlik Sense which uses the SugarJS library to convert a date in natural lanugage to a variable of the actual date.

Examples here: http://sugarjs.com/dates

This extension is in early stages of development. Happy for anyone to contribute! :)

Love Qlik Sense. New to javascript.
